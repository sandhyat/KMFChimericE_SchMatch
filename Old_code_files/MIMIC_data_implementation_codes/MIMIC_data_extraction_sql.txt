This file contains the sql commands that were used to extract the observations from the MIMIC psql database.

1) Labevents for first 24 hours of the first icustay for the patients who survived beyond 24 hours in the first icu stay (joining on hadm_id; important because there are some outpatients with no hadm_id)

SELECT l.*, p.expire_flag, i.dbsource FROM labevents l
INNER JOIN patients p ON p.subject_id = l.subject_id
INNER JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT ON (hadm_id) * from icustays order by hadm_id, intime)  i
ON l.hadm_id = i.hadm_id  
WHERE
(l.charttime between i.intime AND i.intime + interval '1' day)
AND
(p.subject_id
NOT IN
(select patients.subject_id  from patients, (SELECT DISTINCT ON (hadm_id) * from icustays order by hadm_id, intime) i WHERE patients.subject_id=i.subject_id  AND (patients.dod between i.intime and  i.intime + interval '1' day))
);

2) Chartevents for first 24 hours of the first icustay for the patients who survived beyond 24 hours in the first icu stay ( joining on icustay_id)

SELECT ce.*, p.expire_flag, i.dbsource FROM patients p
INNER JOIN chartevents ce ON p.subject_id = ce.subject_id
INNER JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT ON (hadm_id) * from icustays order by hadm_id, intime)  i
ON ce.hadm_id = i.hadm_id  
WHERE
(ce.charttime between i.intime AND i.intime + interval '1' day)
AND
(p.subject_id
NOT IN
(select patients.subject_id  from patients, (SELECT DISTINCT ON (hadm_id) * from icustays order by hadm_id, intime) i_up WHERE patients.subject_id=i_up.subject_id  AND (patients.dod between i_up.intime and  i_up.intime + interval '1' day))
) ;

3) Selecting last event for one admission for one patient of a fixed itemid

select DISTINCT ON (l.subject_id, l.hadm_id, l.itemid) * from source_table l order by l.subject_id, l.hadm_id, l.itemid, charttime DESC;


Final steps:

1) Create temporary table using (1) and (2) above for labevents and chartevents.
2) Use the above generated temporary tables as a source_table in command (3) above to create a table that has the last observation in first 24 hours of the first icustay per itemid per patient.
