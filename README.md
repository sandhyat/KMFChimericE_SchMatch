# KMFInitializedChimericE_Databasematching

This repository contains the code used to generate synthetic datasets and the implementation of proposed Chimeric encoder method on synthetic and real datasets.
Real datasets are not available here due to privacy issues.
Following are the file names and how to use them:

1) Synthetic_data_generation_code.py : This file contains the parameters and the seeds used to generate the synthetic datasets. 
2) Syn_data_Correlation matrices.py : Generates correlation heat maps from the generated synthetic data
3) ACTFAST_Real_Data_exploration.py : Generates correlation heat map for ACTFAST data
4) MIMIC__correlation_plot.py : Generates correlation heat map for processed MIMIC-III dataset
